            This icon means that one or more NPCs can't reach that place, so somewhere in your build the path from an NPC to that location is blocked. This blocked path can be anywhere on your plot, not only by this icon.
            <br><br>Here are some common issues that can lead to a blocked path:
            <br>• You used roof tiles as a flooring, try replacing that by a normal floor that is not a roofing tile.
            <br>• NPCs can only pathfind vertically and horizontally, NOT diagonally. Keep that in mind when designing your store.
            <br>• Shelving that is accessable via multiple sides (like the spinning car display) needs to be accessable via all sides at all times. Just having one side open is not enough.
            <br>• There may be one or more NPCs trapped in a (enclosed) room or a customer in an employee-only zone.

          <p id="employeesandcustomers" class="middlebetweentitle">My manager is not buying any sellables</p>
          <hr class="betweentitledivider">
          <p class="middletextalone">
            The usual issue is that the sellables are waiting at the loading dock, ready to be picked up by you or a <a href="employees-bf-deliverydriver.html">delivery driver</a>.
            <br><br>Even when you have your manager on instant delivery it is still worth checking the loading dock to see if your manager ordered the items from a time you didn't have instant delivery turned on.

          <p class="middletextalone">
            Try replacing your desks with employee-specific desks instead of the any-employee desk you have (accidentally) placed now.
            <br><br>It can be confusing since the any-employee desk looks the exact same as the finance rep-only desk.

            Your <a href="employees-bc-janitor.html">janitor</a> is not asking for a trash bin, but for a dumpster. You can find this in the infrastructure tab in build mode.
            <br><br>This is often a simple translation error.

          <p id="buildmode" class="middlebetweentitle">I am unable to remove lights and other ceiling items in build mode</p>
          <hr class="betweentitledivider">
          <p class="middletextalone">
            In order to remove lights, you will need to navigate to the ceiling tab in build mode and then use the remove tool to remove them.

          <hr class="betweentitledivider">
          <p class="middletextalone">
            If you run into this issue, it means that your store couldn't completely load in.
            <br>Try joining another (less busy) server.
            <br><br>Try playing in a private server by yourself to avoid this issue.

          <hr class="betweentitledivider">
          <p class="middletextalone">
            Money trees give a 2% increase on the PROFIT of items, not on the selling price.
            <br><br>(profit = selling price - buying price)
