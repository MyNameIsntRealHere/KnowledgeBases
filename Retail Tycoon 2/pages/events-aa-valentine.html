      <p class="ContentBetweenTitle">What's an event?</p>
      <p class="ContentFull">An annual event in Retail Tycoon 2 is an automated update that takes place every year for a short period of time. During this time, you can sell limited-time products and you can collect certain items around the map to unlock themed decorations.
        <br><br>The products you buy stay in your inventory when the event has ended, so you can stock up as much as you want!
        <br>The content you unlock by collecting items around the map stays usable even after the event has ended.
        <br>Each year the same content returns to the event so you won't unlock anything extra if you go around the map and collect the items again.
      </p>

      <p class="ContentBetweenTitle">Valentine Event</p>
      <p class="ContentFull">During the valentine event, you can collect 50 candy hearts around the map to unlock valentine decorations (Teddy Bear and Hanging Hearts).
        <br>There are also limited-time valentine items available to sell in your store: Heart Chocolates and Candy Bouquets.
