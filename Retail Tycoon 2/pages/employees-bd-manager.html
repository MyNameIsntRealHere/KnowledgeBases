            A manager is a type of <a href="employees-aa-overview.html">employee</a> you can hire to work in your store.
            <br><br>They help you by ordering sellables. You can configure the amount to stock and whether or not you want to use instant delivery.
            <br><br>Each time they level up, their spending limit goes up by 10% (level 5: 40% higher spending limit).

            The amount to stock option tells your manager how much stock they need to buy:
            <br>• 50%: Your manager will order as much items that are needed to fill all your shelves half full.
            <br>• 100%: Your manager will order as much items to fill all your shelves fully.
            <br>• 150%: Your manager will order as much items to fill all your shelves fully + have as much items in storage to fill all your shelves for 50% again.
            <br>• 200%: Your manager will order as much items to be able to fill all your shelves twice.
            <br><br>Having multiple managers set to 200% won't make them stock to 400%, they will work together to reach the goal of 200%.
          </p>

          <p class="middletextalone">
            You can choose to enable the option "instant delivery". This will increase the price of the sellables your manager buys by 25%, but they will go directly into your stores storage, eliminating the need to transport them from the loading dock to your store.
